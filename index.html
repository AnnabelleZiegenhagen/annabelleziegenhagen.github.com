                <p><img src="images/headshot.png" alt="photo" class="alignleft">My collection of work expresses my peripatetic longings. Stories of splendor and filth - the gritty and dark secrets of a young generation lost in a society overcome by environmental and social destruction. I hope to communicate the two worlds in which my work resides, the commercial-traditional as a studio and wedding photographer - and the intimate relationships of portraits. <p> I love the unconventional and convoluted; I find solace in technical error and mistakes; I’m a believer in few images, and solid collections. I’m lucky to have photography as a means of establishing partnership with nonprofits and individuals all over the world seeking documentation and storytelling. </p>
				<p>I do portrait, event, and private photography by commission. I also do design through other creative outlets in layout and communications. I create anything from websites to fliers. My work is an outlet through which I communicate and learn, whether it's a wedding, senior portrait, or private tutoring. I welcome trading for handcrafted knives and foot massages. </p>
